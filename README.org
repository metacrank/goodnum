#+description: A better string based number library that works with reverse notation.

A library for working with string based numbers that handles utf-8 encoded reverse and
alternate bases.
* The Problem
One would like to work with reverse-notation numbers and in different bases when working
with string based numbers, due to the benefits of systems such as dozenal reverse and
chronal reverse. However, no current low level library attempts to do this, so we made our
own.
